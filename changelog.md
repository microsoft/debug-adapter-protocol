  * Fix a mistake in the description of the `ExceptionFilterOptions` type.

* 1.54.x:

  * Add `memory` event and a corresponding **client** capability `supportsMemoryEvent`.

* 1.48.x:
  * Add guidance for the case that a debug adapter implements both `setVariable` and `setExpression` and clients need to decide which request to use.
  * Add `writeMemory` request and a corresponding `supportsWriteMemoryRequest` capability.

* 1.47.x:
  * The `setExceptionBreakpoints` can now optionally return an array of `Breakpoint`s as the other `setXxxxBreakpoints` do. This allows clients to show validation error messages for individual exception breakpoints or filters.
  * The `restart` request got a new optional parameter `arguments` where a client can pass the latest version of a launch or attach configuration.
  * Adds a new optional argument `suspendDebuggee` to the `disconnect` request. If a debug adapter has opted into this feature with the `supportSuspendDebuggee` capability, a client can use this to control whether the debuggee should be suspended when the debugger is disconnected.

  * Add support for conditional exceptions. With this the `setExceptionBreakpoints` request got a new property `filterOptions` for setting the exception filters and their conditions. The corresponding capability is `supportsExceptionFilterOptions`.
  * Clarify the description of the `stackTrace` request and its `totalFrames` property.

  * New value `clipboard` for `context` argument of `evaluate` request.
  * Add support for reporting progress via `progressStart`, `progressUpdate`, and `progressEnd` events and a corresponding **client** capability `supportsProgressReporting`. Progress can be cancelled via a new `progressId` argument for the `cancel` request.
  * Clarifed descriptions of all optional requests, events, and attributes to make clear what is the corresponding capability.

* 1.39.x:
  * add optional `selectionStart` and `selectionLength` attributes to completion item. With these attributes the selection range or position can be controlled after the completion text has been inserted.

  * Introduces a capability `completionTriggerCharacters` for announcing the characters that a frontend UI should use to trigger completion.
  * Adds an optional `sortText` attribute to the `CompletionItem` type.
  * In the schema change "number" to "integer" in cases where a float makes no sense, e.g. for IDs.

* 1.35.x:
  * Adds an optional `presentationHint` attribute to the `Scope` type which can be used to add semantic to the scope's contents. An example is to mark a scope as a "registers" scope that contains "registers" instead of variables.

  * Move specification to DAP web site.

* 1.31.x:
  * Adds a new optional `terminate` request which can be used to give a debuggee the chance to shutdown gracefully. A corresponding `supportsTerminateRequest` capability announces that an adapter implements the request.

* 1.30.x:
  * Comment cosmetics.

  * Adds a new value for the 'reason' attribute of the 'stopped' event. This is used when an adapter implements the 'goto' request.

  * Made the `__restart` attribute official on the `launch` or `attach` requests. It corresponds to the `restart` attribute on the `terminated` event.
  * Adds a `setExpression` request and a corresponding `supportsSetExpression` capability. This request can be used to assign a value to an assignable expression (aka "l-value").
  * Adds a new optional `preserveFocusHint` to the `stopped` event. A value of true hints to the frontend that this event should not change the focus.

* 1.27.x:

  * Adds capability `supportsDelayedStackTraceLoading` that indicates that a debug adapter supports the delayed loading of parts of the stack. This requires that both the `startFrame` and `levels` arguments and the `totalFrames` result of the `StackTraceRequest` are supported.

* 1.20.x:
  * Extends the type of the `TerminatedEvent.body.restart` attribute from `boolean` to `any`. This makes it possible to loop arbitrary data from one debug session to the next.
  * Adds a new enum value `subtle` for the `presentationHint` attribute of type `StackFrame`.

* 1.19.x:
